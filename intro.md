# What is this book?

This is a small sample book to give you a feel of **What chatGPT is able to do**.
Of course, this is not a complete book, and it is not meant to be.
This is a list of interesting things, in a form of a Book, that chatGPT was able to structure and generate.

It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [this blog](https://www.emanuelevivoli.me) for more information about the (partial) author of this book (me).

# How was this book generated?

This book was generated using [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), an OpenAI API that allows you to chat with a GPT-3 model.
The model was trained on a large corpus of text, and it is able to generate new text, given a prompt.

The prompt for this book will be reported here, as well as the all chat, as chatGPT web interface allows chat history now.

# **ERRORS may appear**
If you find any errors, please let me know by opening an issue on [GitHub](www.github.com/emanuelevivoli/AI4newbies).
In case, we'll ask ChatGPT to correct the errors. Yey!
