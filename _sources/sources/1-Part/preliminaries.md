## Chapters

### 1. [Programming with Notebooks](1.Programming_with_Notebooks.ipynb)
The notebook (or Jupyter notebook) is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. It is a powerful tool for data analysis, data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more. It is a great tool for data scientists, researchers, engineers, students and teachers. It is also a great tool for AI4noobs. Here we will see how to use it.

### 2. [Introduction to Programming](2.Introduction_to_Programming.ipynb)
Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to execute. It is a skill that is essential for AI. Here we will see the basics of programming.

### 3. [Data Structures](3.Data_Structures.ipynb)
Data structures are a way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures are a fundamental part of computer science. Here we will see the basics of data structures.

### 4. [Computational Complexity](4.Computational_Complexity.ipynb)
Computational complexity is a measure of the amount of resources (time and space) required by an algorithm to run. It is a fundamental concept in computer science. Here we will see the basics of computational complexity.

### 5. [Statistics](5.Statistics.ipynb)
Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting data. It is a fundamental concept in AI. Here we will see the basics of statistics.

### 6. [Linear Algebra](6.Linear_Algebra.ipynb)
Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations and linear transformations. It is a fundamental concept in AI. Here we will see the basics of linear algebra.

### 7. [Geometry](7.Geometry.ipynb)
Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with shapes and their properties. It is a fundamental concept in AI. Here we will see the basics of geometry.

### 8. [Calculus](8.Calculus.ipynb)
Calculus is the branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change. It is a fundamental concept in AI. Here we will see the basics of calculus.
