    "One of the key features of supercomputers is their ability to perform large numbers of calculations simultaneously, using a technique known as parallel processing. This enables them to process data much faster than traditional computers, which can only perform one calculation at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supercomputers are typically used in research and scientific applications, as well as in industries such as finance, energy, and aerospace. They are often located in specialized facilities known as supercomputing centers, which provide access to the computer for researchers and scientists from around the world.\n",
