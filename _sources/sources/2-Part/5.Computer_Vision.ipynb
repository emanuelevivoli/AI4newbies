    "## 5.2 ****Image Classification****\n",
    "\n",
    "Image classification is the task of assigning a label or category to an image. It is used in applications such as image search engines, where the goal is to return images that are relevant to a given query, and image tagging, where the goal is to assign descriptive tags to images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach to image classification is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are neural networks designed to process data with a grid-like topology. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks because they can learn local patterns and features in the image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are trained using an objective function such as cross-entropy loss, which measures the difference between the predicted label and the true label. For example, suppose we have a dataset of images of animals, and we want to classify the images into different categories such as \"dog\", \"cat\", \"bird\", etc. The cross-entropy loss function might be defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J = - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \\log p(y_i | x_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log (1 - p(y_i | x_i))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $N$ is the number of images in the dataset, $y_i$ is the true label of image $i$ (represented as a one-hot vector), $x_i$ is the input image, and $p(y_i | x_i)$ is the predicted probability of the true label given the input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the CNN has been trained, it can be used to classify new images by passing the images through the network and using the output layer to predict the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recent Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there have been a number of advances in the field of image classification, including the development of deeper CNN architectures such as ResNets and Inception networks, and the use of techniques such as batch normalization and dropout to improve model generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular approach is to use a transformer architecture, which was originally developed for natural language processing tasks but has also been applied to image classification. The transformer architecture uses self-attention mechanisms to allow the model to attend to different parts of the input image at different times, which allows it to capture global dependencies in the image data.\n",
