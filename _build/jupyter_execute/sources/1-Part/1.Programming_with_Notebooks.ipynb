    "Notebooks are interactive documents that allow you to combine code, text, and other media in a single document. They are a popular tool for data science and machine learning because they allow you to write, test, and debug code in an organized and efficient manner. Notebooks are also great for documenting and sharing your work with others.\n",

Jupyter notebooks use the **`.ipynb`** file extension and are based on the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.

    "Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in data science and machine learning. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility, which make it a great choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Python is also highly extensible, with a large and active community of developers who have created a vast array of libraries and tools for a wide range of applications.\n",

    "- Built-in support for common data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets\n",
    "- A rich set of standard libraries, including libraries for math, statistics, string manipulation, and more\n",

    "To get started with Python notebooks, you will need to install a software application that can run them. One of the most popular options is JupyterLab, which is an open-source web-based application that you can install on your own computer or use online through a service such as Google Colab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have JupyterLab installed, you can create a new Python notebook by selecting the \"Python 3\" option from the \"New\" menu. This will open a new notebook with a default name, such as \"Untitled.ipynb\", and a default kernel, which is the Python interpreter that will execute the code in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write and execute code in a notebook, you can use cells. There are two types of cells: code cells and markdown cells. Code cells contain Python code and are indicated by the **`In [ ]:`** prefix. Markdown cells contain text and are indicated by the **`In [ ]:`** prefix. You can execute a code cell by pressing **`Shift+Enter`** or clicking the \"Run\" button in the toolbar.\n",
