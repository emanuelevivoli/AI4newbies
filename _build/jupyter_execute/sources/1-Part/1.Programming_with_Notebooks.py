# # 1. Programming with Notebooks

# ## 1.1 Introduction to Notebooks
# 
# Notebooks are interactive documents that allow you to combine code, text, and other media in a single document. They are a popular tool for data science and machine learning because they allow you to write, test, and debug code in an organized and efficient manner. Notebooks are also great for documenting and sharing your work with others.
# 
# There are several types of notebooks, including Jupyter notebooks, which are the most widely used. Jupyter notebooks use the **`.ipynb`** file extension and are based on the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. They are designed to be run in a web browser and can be opened and edited using a variety of software applications, including JupyterLab and Google Colab.
# 
# 

# ### Introduction to Python
# 
# Python is a popular programming language that is widely used in data science and machine learning. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility, which make it a great choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Python is also highly extensible, with a large and active community of developers who have created a vast array of libraries and tools for a wide range of applications.
# 
# Some of the key features of Python include:
# 
# - Dynamic typing, which allows you to assign values to variables without specifying their type
# - Automatic memory management, which frees you from the need to manually allocate and deallocate memory
# - Built-in support for common data structures, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets
# - A rich set of standard libraries, including libraries for math, statistics, string manipulation, and more
# - Support for object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming styles
# 

# 
# ### Example: Getting Started with Python Notebooks
# 
# To get started with Python notebooks, you will need to install a software application that can run them. One of the most popular options is JupyterLab, which is an open-source web-based application that you can install on your own computer or use online through a service such as Google Colab.
# 
# Once you have JupyterLab installed, you can create a new Python notebook by selecting the "Python 3" option from the "New" menu. This will open a new notebook with a default name, such as "Untitled.ipynb", and a default kernel, which is the Python interpreter that will execute the code in your notebook.
# 
# To write and execute code in a notebook, you can use cells. There are two types of cells: code cells and markdown cells. Code cells contain Python code and are indicated by the **`In [ ]:`** prefix. Markdown cells contain text and are indicated by the **`In [ ]:`** prefix. You can execute a code cell by pressing **`Shift+Enter`** or clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar.
# 
# Here is an example of a simple Python code cell that prints a message:

# In[1]:


print("Hello, world!")


# When you execute this cell, the output will be displayed below the cell:
# 
# 

# Hello, world!

# ## 1.2 Getting started with notebooks

# 
# 
# 
# 
# ### Inserting and Executing Cells
# 
# In a Jupyter notebook, you can insert a new cell by clicking the "New Cell" button in the toolbar, or by using the keyboard shortcut **`Shift+Enter`**. By default, new cells are inserted as code cells, but you can change the cell type by selecting a different option from the "Cell Type" dropdown menu in the toolbar.
# 
# To execute a cell, you can press **`Shift+Enter`** or click the "Run" button in the toolbar. When you execute a code cell, the Python interpreter will execute the code and display the output below the cell. When you execute a markdown cell, the cell will be rendered as formatted text.
# 
# 

# ### Moving and Deleting Cells
# 
# You can move cells up or down within a notebook by clicking the "Up" or "Down" arrow buttons in the toolbar, or by using the keyboard shortcuts **`Ctrl+Shift+Up`** or **`Ctrl+Shift+Down`**. You can delete a cell by clicking the "Cut Cell" button in the toolbar, or by using the keyboard shortcut **`Ctrl+X`**.
# 
# 

# ### Editing Cells
# 
# To edit a cell, you can simply click inside the cell and start typing. If you are editing a code cell, you can use the syntax highlighting and autocomplete features to help you write your code. If you are editing a markdown cell, you can use the formatting toolbar to apply formatting to your text.
# 
# To save your changes, you can click the "Save" button in the toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut **`Ctrl+S`**. To undo your changes, you can click the "Undo" button in the toolbar, or use the keyboard shortcut **`Ctrl+Z`**.
# 
# 

# ### Keyboard Shortcuts
# 
# Jupyter notebooks provide a number of keyboard shortcuts that can save you time and make it easier to work with cells. Some of the most useful keyboard shortcuts include:
# 
# - **`Shift+Enter`**: Execute cell and move to next cell
# - **`Ctrl+Enter`**: Execute cell
# - **`Ctrl+Shift+Up`**: Move cell up
# - **`Ctrl+Shift+Down`**: Move cell down
# - **`Ctrl+X`**: Cut cell
# - **`Ctrl+C`**: Copy cell
# - **`Ctrl+V`**: Paste cell
# - **`Ctrl+Z`**: Undo
# - **`Ctrl+Y`**: Redo
# - **`Ctrl+S`**: Save
# 
# 

# ## 1.3 Collaborating with notebooks

# 
# 
# ### Sharing Notebooks
# 
# One of the great benefits of Jupyter notebooks is that they are easy to share with others. You can share your notebooks with collaborators by sending them a link to your notebook file, or by exporting the notebook as a different file format such as HTML, PDF, or Python script.
# 
# To share a link to your notebook, you can use the "Copy Link" button in the JupyterLab interface, or copy the URL from the address bar in your web browser. To export your notebook, you can use the "File > Export Notebook As" menu, or use the keyboard shortcut **`Ctrl+Shift+E`**.
# 
# ### Collaborating on Notebooks
# 
# Jupyter notebooks also provide a number of features that can make it easier to collaborate with others on a single notebook. For example, you can use the "Cell > All Output > Clear" menu to clear the output of all cells in a notebook, which can make it easier to share a clean version of your notebook with others.
# 
# You can also use the "Cell > All Output > Toggle Scrolling" menu to toggle the scrolling of long output, which can make it easier to navigate through a notebook with lots of output.
# 
# Finally, you can use the "View > Cell Toolbar > Slideshow" menu to create a slideshow from your notebook, which can be useful for presenting your work to others.
