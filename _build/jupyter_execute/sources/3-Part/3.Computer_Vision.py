# # 3. Computer Vision

# ## 3.1 Introduction to computer vision
# 
# Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual data from the world around them. This includes tasks such as image and video recognition, object detection, and scene understanding.
# 
# In this chapter, we will introduce the basics of computer vision and discuss some of the most common applications of this technology. We will also explore some of the challenges and limitations of current computer vision algorithms and how researchers are working to overcome them. Finally, we will provide a case study to demonstrate how computer vision can be used to solve real-world problems.

# ## 3.2 Image recognition and classification
# 
# Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that deals with the design and development of algorithms and systems that can understand, interpret, and analyze visual data from the real world. Image recognition and classification are two fundamental tasks in computer vision that involve identifying objects, people, scenes, and other elements in images or videos.
# 
# There are several approaches to image recognition and classification, including traditional machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines and decision trees, as well as deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These techniques can be used to classify images into predefined categories, such as animals, plants, and vehicles, or to recognize specific objects, such as faces, traffic signs, and texts.
# 
# In order to perform image recognition and classification, a computer vision system typically relies on a large dataset of labeled images, which are used to train the model. The training process involves feeding the model with the images and their corresponding labels, and adjusting the model's parameters in order to minimize the error between the predicted labels and the ground truth labels.
# 
# Once the model is trained, it can be tested on a separate dataset of images to evaluate its performance. If the model performs well on the test dataset, it can be deployed in a real-world application, such as a security camera, a self-driving car, or a mobile app.
# 
# In this section, we will provide an overview of image recognition and classification, and discuss some of the challenges and opportunities in this field. We will also present some examples of image recognition and classification using Python and popular machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn and Pytorch.

import torch
import torchvision

# Load the CIFAR-10 dataset
dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='.', download=True)

# Define the model
model = torchvision.models.resnet18(num_classes=10)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# Train the model
for epoch in range(10):
  for data, target in dataset:
    # Forward pass
    output = model(data)
    loss = loss_fn(output, target)

    # Backward pass
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

  print(f'Epoch {epoch+1} loss: {loss.item()}')

# Test the model
model.eval()
correct = 0
total = 0

with torch.no_grad():
  for data, target in dataset:
    output = model(data)
    _, predicted = torch.max(output.data, 1)
    total += target.size(0)
    correct += (predicted == target).sum().item()

print(f'Accuracy: {correct / total}')


# This code trains a ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset for image recognition and classification. The model is trained for 10 epochs and the accuracy is printed at the end.

# ## 3.3 Object detection and tracking
# 
# In object detection and tracking, the goal is to identify and locate objects of interest in images or video streams. This can be achieved through a variety of methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are particularly effective at image classification and object detection tasks.
# 
# One popular approach for object detection is the Single Shot Detector (SSD) algorithm, which uses a CNN to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects in an image. Another approach is the Faster R-CNN algorithm, which combines a region proposal network with a CNN to simultaneously predict object bounds and classify the objects.
# 
# Object tracking, on the other hand, involves tracking the movement of objects from frame to frame in a video stream. One common method for object tracking is the Kalman filter, which uses a combination of prediction and correction steps to estimate the state of an object over time. Other methods for object tracking include the Lucas-Kanade algorithm and the mean shift algorithm.
# 
# In the context of deep learning, object detection and tracking can be useful for a wide range of applications, including self-driving cars, video surveillance, and augmented reality.

# ## 3.4 Case study: Self-driving cars
# 
# Self-driving cars use a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques to navigate roads and make driving decisions. One key aspect of self-driving car technology is the ability to detect and classify objects in the environment. This involves training a machine learning model on a large dataset of labeled images, which could include pedestrians, vehicles, traffic lights, and other objects.
# 
# To detect and classify objects in real-time, self-driving cars use sensors such as cameras, LIDAR, and radar to gather data about the environment. These sensors provide a stream of data that is fed into the machine learning model, which processes the data and makes a prediction about what objects are present in the scene.
# 
# In addition to object detection, self-driving cars also use computer vision techniques to track the movement of objects over time. This is important for predicting the trajectory of other vehicles and pedestrians, and making safe driving decisions.
# 
# One example of a self-driving car case study is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify road signs. In this case, a CNN is trained on a dataset of images of road signs, and is able to accurately classify new images of road signs with high accuracy. The CNN is then integrated into the self-driving car system, allowing the car to detect and classify road signs in real-time as it drives.
# 
# In summary, computer vision plays a crucial role in the development of self-driving car technology, enabling the car to perceive and understand its environment in order to make safe and efficient driving decisions.
