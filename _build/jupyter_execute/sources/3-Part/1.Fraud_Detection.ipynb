    "## 1.1 Introduction to fraud detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud detection is a common application of artificial intelligence in many industries. It involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in data and identify unusual or suspicious activity. Fraud can take many forms, including financial fraud, identity theft, and other types of crime. In order to detect fraud effectively, it is important to have a good understanding of the types of fraud that can occur, as well as the characteristics of fraudulent activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different techniques that can be used for fraud detection, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning. In supervised learning, the machine learning algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which includes both fraudulent and non-fraudulent examples. The algorithm then uses this training data to learn to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent activity. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is not given any labeled examples, but is instead expected to discover patterns in the data on its own. Semi-supervised learning combines elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning, using a small number of labeled examples to guide the algorithm in its discovery of patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges of fraud detection is the imbalanced nature of the data. Fraudulent activity is typically much rarer than non-fraudulent activity, which can make it difficult for machine learning algorithms to accurately identify fraudulent patterns. To address this issue, it is often necessary to use techniques such as oversampling and undersampling to balance the data and improve the accuracy of the machine learning model."

    "## 1.2 Types of fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud can take many forms and can occur in a variety of contexts. Some common types of fraud include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Financial fraud, Financial fraud involves the use of deceptive practices for financial gain. This can include things like credit card fraud, identity theft, and money laundering.\n",
    "- Insurance fraud, Insurance fraud involves making false claims or providing false information in order to obtain insurance benefits. This can include things like staging accidents, exaggerating the extent of an injury, or pretending to have lost property that was never actually lost.\n",
    "- Investment fraud, Investment fraud involves persuading individuals to invest in a scheme that is not legitimate. This can include things like Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, and investment fraud involving stocks or securities.\n",
    "- Health care fraud, Health care fraud involves making false claims or providing false information in order to obtain health care benefits. This can include things like billing for services that were not provided, using false diagnoses to justify unnecessary treatments, and prescribing unnecessary medications.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Rule-based systems**: These systems rely on a set of pre-defined rules to identify fraudulent activity. For example, a rule-based system might flag any transactions that are larger than a certain amount as potentially fraudulent.\n",
    "- **Behavioral analysis**: This approach involves analyzing the behavior of individuals or groups in order to identify patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity. For example, if an individual's spending patterns suddenly change, this could be a sign of fraudulent activity.\n",
    "- **Machine learning**: Machine learning algorithms can be trained to identify patterns in data that may indicate fraudulent activity. For example, a machine learning model might be trained to identify patterns in transaction data that are characteristic of fraudulent activity.\n",
    "- **Anomaly detection**: This approach involves identifying deviations from normal behavior that may indicate fraudulent activity. For example, if an individual's spending patterns are significantly different from those of their peers, this could be a sign of fraudulent activity.\n",
    "\n",
