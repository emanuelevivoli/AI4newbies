# # 4. Vocal AI
# 
# 

# ## 4.1 Introduction to vocal AI
# 
# Vocal AI, or artificial intelligence for speech and voice, is a field of AI that focuses on the development of computer systems that can understand, interpret, and generate human speech and voice. Vocal AI technologies have a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, natural language processing, voice assistants, and speech synthesis. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize how we communicate and interact with computers, making it easier and more natural to access information and perform tasks.
# 
# One of the key challenges in developing vocal AI technologies is the complexity and variability of human speech and voice. Human speech is often ambiguous, context-dependent, and influenced by factors such as accent, dialect, and emotion. In order to accurately understand and generate human speech, vocal AI systems must be able to handle these complexities and variations.
# 
# There are several approaches to developing vocal AI technologies, including rule-based systems, statistical models, and deep learning methods. Each approach has its own strengths and limitations, and the most effective vocal AI systems often combine multiple approaches.
# 
# In this chapter, we will explore the basics of vocal AI and the key technologies and applications in this field. We will also look at some of the challenges and opportunities in the development of vocal AI, and discuss the potential impact of these technologies on society and industry.
#

# ## 4.2 Speech recognition
# 
# In speech recognition, the goal is to convert spoken language into text. This can be used in a variety of applications, such as dictation, voice-to-text messaging, and voice commands for devices. There are several approaches to speech recognition, including:
# 
# 1. Rule-based: This approach involves using a set of predefined rules and heuristics to recognize speech.
# 2. Connectionist: This approach involves using artificial neural networks to recognize speech.
# 3. HMM (hidden Markov model): This approach involves using statistical models to recognize speech.
# 
# 

# ### example using Google
# 
# To implement speech recognition in Python, you can use libraries such as **`SpeechRecognition`** or **`pocketsphinx`**. Here is an example of how to use the **`SpeechRecognition`** library to recognize speech from a microphone:
# 

# In[1]:


import speech_recognition as sr

# create a recognizer object
r = sr.Recognizer()

# start listening to the microphone
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Say something:")
    audio = r.listen(source)

# recognize the speech
try:
    print("You said: " + r.recognize_google(audio))
except sr.UnknownValueError:
    print("Could not understand audio")
except sr.RequestError as e:
    print("Error making request: {0}".format(e))


# This code will listen to the microphone, and when you speak it will try to recognize the speech and print it out. Note that this example uses the Google Speech Recognition API, which requires an internet connection.

# ### example using pytorch
# 
# Here is an example of how to perform speech recognition using PyTorch:
# 
# First, we will need to install the **`torchaudio`** library, which provides functionality for loading and processing audio data in PyTorch. We can install it using **`pip install torchaudio`**.
# 
# Next, we will need to download a pre-trained speech recognition model. For this example, we will use the **`DeepSpeech2`** model, which can be downloaded from the **`torchaudio`** website or by running the following command:
# 
# ```bash
# wget https://download.pytorch.org/models/deepspeech2-9f5f8983.pth
# ```
# 
# Now we can load the model and use it to transcribe an audio file. Here is some example code that does this:
# 

# In[ ]:


import torch
import torchaudio

# Load the pre-trained model
model = torchaudio.models.DeepSpeech2(rnn_hidden_size=1024, n_hidden=30)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('deepspeech2-9f5f8983.pth'))
model.eval()

# Load the audio file and pre-process it
waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load('audio.wav')
waveform = waveform.squeeze(0)  # remove the dummy batch dimension

# Transcribe the audio
with torch.no_grad():
    output = model(waveform)

# Convert the output to text
text = torch.argmax(output, dim=1).tolist()
text = ''.join([chr(c) for c in text])

print(text)


# This code loads the **`DeepSpeech2`** model, loads an audio file, and transcribes it using the model. The output is a list of character indices, which we convert to a string of characters using a list comprehension. The resulting string is the transcribed text.

# ### example using pytorch and custom model
# 
# Here is an example of using PyTorch for speech recognition:

# In[ ]:


import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple convolutional neural network
class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv1d(1, 16, kernel_size=3, stride=2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv1d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2)
        self.conv3 = nn.Conv1d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 32)
        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(32, 16)
        self.fc5 = nn.Linear(16, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.conv2(x)
        x = self.conv3(x)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        x = self.fc3(x)
        x = self.fc4(x)
        x = self.fc5(x)
        return x

# Load the dataset and preprocess it
import torchaudio

dataset = torchaudio.datasets.VCTK(root='path/to/VCTK/dir')
data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# Train the model
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(data_loader):
        inputs = inputs.unsqueeze(1)
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()


# This example trains a simple convolutional neural network on the VCTK dataset for speech recognition. The dataset is loaded using the **`torchaudio`** library, which handles all the preprocessing steps such as filtering and normalization. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the cross-entropy loss function.

# ## 4.3 Case study: Virtual assistants
# 
# Virtual assistants are a popular application of vocal AI, and they have become an integral part of many people's daily lives. These assistants, such as Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa, are able to understand and respond to voice commands and questions.
# 
# To build a virtual assistant, you need to first develop a speech recognition system that can understand and transcribe spoken words. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including hidden Markov models, Gaussian mixture models, and deep learning approaches.
# 
# Once you have a speech recognition system in place, you can use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the meaning of the words and generate appropriate responses. NLP is a field of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and humans through the use of natural language.
# 
# Here is an example of how you can use a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's **`transformers`** library to build a virtual assistant in PyTorch:
# 
# First, let's install the required libraries:
# 

# In[ ]:


get_ipython().system('pip install transformers')
get_ipython().system('pip install torch')


# Next, we can use the **`GPT2LMHeadModel`** class from the **`transformers`** library to load a pre-trained language model. This model has been trained to generate human-like text, so it can be used to generate responses for our virtual assistant:

# In[ ]:


import transformers

# Load a pre-trained language model
model = transformers.GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Set the model to evaluation mode
model.eval()


# Now that we have our pre-trained model loaded, we can use it to generate responses to user input. Here is a simple function that takes a user's input and returns a response generated by the model:

# In[ ]:


import torch

def generate_response(input_text):
    # Encode the input text and add the special tokens
    input_tokens = model.tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

    # Generate a response
    response_tokens = model.generate(input_tokens, max_length=128)

    # Decode the response and remove the special tokens
    response_text = model.tokenizer.decode(response_tokens[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

    return response_text


# Finally, we can use our virtual assistant by calling the **`generate_response`** function with user input:

# In[ ]:


user_input = "Hello, how are you?"
response = generate_response(user_input)

print(response)
# Output: I'm doing well, thanks for asking! How about you?


# This is just a simple example of how you can use a pre-trained language model to build a virtual assistant in PyTorch. You can experiment with different models and customize the virtual assistant to suit your needs.
