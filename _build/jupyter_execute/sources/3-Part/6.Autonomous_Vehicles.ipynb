    "## 6.1 Introduction to autonomous vehicles\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving vehicles, are vehicles that are capable of sensing their environment and navigating without the need for human input. These vehicles use a combination of sensors, such as lidar, radar, and cameras, to gather data about their surroundings and make decisions based on that data. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to greatly improve transportation efficiency, reduce accidents, and provide mobility to people who are unable to drive due to disability or age. In this chapter, we will explore the basics of autonomous vehicles and their applications in the real world.\n",

    "## 6.2 Sensors and perception\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous vehicles rely on a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings and navigate safely. These sensors include cameras, lidar, radar, and ultrasonic sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cameras are used to capture visual information about the environment, including the location of other vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and road signs. Lidar, or Light Detection and Ranging, uses lasers to measure the distance to objects and create a 3D map of the environment. Radar uses radio waves to detect objects and measure their distance and speed. Ultrasonic sensors use sound waves to detect objects and measure distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data collected by these sensors is used by the autonomous vehicle's perception system to understand the environment and make decisions about how to navigate safely.\n",

    "## 6.3 Decision making and control\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous vehicles rely on artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to make decisions and control the vehicle. These algorithms take input from various sensors, such as cameras, lidar, radar, and GPS, to understand the environment and make decisions about how to navigate and control the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key aspect of decision making and control for autonomous vehicles is the ability to predict the actions of other vehicles and pedestrians. This can be achieved through the use of machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, which are trained on large datasets of vehicle and pedestrian behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of decision making and control for autonomous vehicles is the ability to handle edge cases and unexpected situations. This can be achieved through the use of machine learning algorithms that are able to adapt and learn from new situations and environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure the safety of autonomous vehicles, it is important to have multiple layers of redundancy and fail-safes in place. This can include multiple sensors and control systems, as well as manual override mechanisms that allow a human operator to take control of the vehicle in emergency situations.\n",

    "## 6.4 Case study: Autonomous drones\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous drones are a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that are able to operate without human intervention. These drones can be programmed to perform a variety of tasks, including mapping, surveillance, and delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable autonomous flight, drones rely on a combination of sensors and algorithms to perceive their surroundings and make decisions about how to navigate and control their movements. Some common sensors used in autonomous drones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cameras: These can be used for visual perception and to identify features in the environment, such as buildings, roads, and other objects.\n",
    "- Lidar: This type of sensor uses lasers to measure distance and create a 3D map of the environment. Lidar can be used to detect obstacles and determine the location and orientation of the drone.\n",
    "- Radar: Radar sensors can be used to detect objects at long range and can be useful for detecting objects that are hard to see with cameras, such as those that are transparent or moving quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make decisions about how to navigate and control the drone, algorithms are used to process the data from these sensors and determine the best course of action. Some common decision-making algorithms used in autonomous drones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Path planning: This involves determining a safe and efficient route for the drone to follow. Path planning algorithms can take into account the drone's current position, its destination, and any obstacles or constraints in the environment.\n",
    "- Control: Once a path has been planned, control algorithms are used to determine the necessary control inputs (e.g., thrust, pitch, yaw) to follow the path and maintain stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous drones have a wide range of potential applications, including search and rescue, delivery of goods, and mapping and surveying. For example, an autonomous drone could be used to deliver medical supplies to remote areas, or to inspect infrastructure such as bridges or power lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, it is likely that autonomous drones will become more widespread and will be used for an even wider range of tasks. However, there are also challenges to be overcome, including regulatory issues and concerns about safety and privacy."
